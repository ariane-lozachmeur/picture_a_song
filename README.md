# Picture A Song
Python module to create a fun visual from a song lyrics

## Inspiration
This module was inspired by the Vox video "Why we really like repetition in music" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzzmqUoQobc).
The idea was to reproduce the visual used in the video.
Visit this awesome website (https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/) for more about song repetition over time!

## Usage
Copy the song's lyrics in a <title>.txt file in the songs/ folder \
Execute ``` python3 main.py <title> ``` \
See the image in the pictures/ folder!

## Next steps
I want to add more functionnalities, like the ability to compute metrics about the song to compare style/decades of musics.
Contact me with any idea you might have!
