# Picture A Song
Python module to create a fun visual from a song lyrics

## Inspiration
This module was inspired by the Vox video "Why we really like repetition in music" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzzmqUoQobc).
The idea was to reproduce the visual used in the video: The picture represent word repetition in the song. Words of the song constitute the rows and columns of the matrix, when the row and column are identical, the pixel is colored, otherwise it is black. The visual clearly show the repetition of choruses and verses with colored squares appearing periodically.
Visit this awesome website (https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/) for more about song repetition over time!

## Usage
Copy the song's lyrics in a <title>.txt file in the songs/ folder \
Execute ``` python3 main.py <title> ``` \
See the image in the pictures/ folder!

## Next steps
I want to add more functionnalities, like the ability to compute metrics about the song to compare style/decades of musics.
Contact me with any idea you might have!
